- Climate Change
- The burning of fossil fuels and gasses releases smoke and carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.
- Alongside methane from many grazing animals, these substances break down the ozone layer.
- The ozone layer helps block out some of the Sun's heat.
- These chemicals also help trap the heat in the atmosphere which is called the greenhouse effect.
- The Earth heating up causes many issues all around the planet.
- One issue is that the glaciers are starting to melt which rises the sea level, harming the people and animals on the shores.
