- Climate Change
- The burning of fossil fuels and gasses releases smoke and carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.
- Alongside methane from many grazing animals, these substances break down the ozone layer.
- The ozone layer helps block out some of the Sun's heat.
- These chemicals also help trap the heat in the atmosphere which is called the greenhouse effect.
- The Earth heating up causes many issues all around the planet.
- One issue is that the glaciers are starting to melt which rises the sea level, harming the people and animals on the shores.
- Another issue is that the melting of the glaciers changes the salt levels in the oceans which disturbs many speicies.
- One way this can be prevented is by increasing the amount of plants and algae.
- Historically algae has been responsible for removing dangerous chamicals from the atmosphere and replacing it.
- Some other ways are for people to use products that do not affect the atmosphere.
- Sadly, the individual person cannot make much of a difference.
- With many people in power not caring about the environment climate change still is a major issue.
- A lot of cleaner optiions are more not used due to them being more expensive or looking bad in the eyes of the people.
- For example, some nuclear reactors have been replaced with coal plants to appease the population.
- Nuclear plants create waste that has the potential to harm many people while coal plants create waste that harms people in the moment.
- Coal plant waste is more subtle than nuclear disasters so their reputation is better.
- The best way to prevent this is to be informed on what is actually least harmful to the environment.
- Once that is done, people in power who do not support the clener options need to be removed in favor for people who do.
